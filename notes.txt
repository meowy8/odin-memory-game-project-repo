- scoreboard with current score and highscore
- highscore updates when the current score is reset to zero if the current score is higher than it

- cards showing images fetched from api
- everytime a card is clicked the board of cards shuffles
- this can be done by randomising what image src is sent to each card or maybe randomising the order of the card in an array
- this function should be invoked when the component mounts

App() {
  [ currentScore, setCurrentScore ] = useState(0)
  [ bestScore, setBestScore ] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <Card />
      <Card />
      <Card />
      <Card />
      <Card />
      <Card />
    </div>
  )
